    Developed for a custom Shopify site, this project acts as a proxy to efficiently store customer email addresses via the server-side Shopify admin API, specifically catering to newsletter marketing needs.

    The API's primary role is to facilitate the storage of unverified email addresses in Shopify, initiate the generation of a verification email, and subsequently update the email status to 'verified' following user interaction. It also provides a user-friendly unsubscribe feature. 

    Developed using Express JS, JSON Web Token (JWT), Nodemailer, and integrated with the Shopify Admin API, this project offers a robust solution for email management.
